your airline is awesome but your lax loft needs to step up its game. $40 for dirty tables and floors
"not worried, it's been a great ride in a new plane with great crew. All airlines should be like this."
awesome. I flew yall Sat morning. Any way we can correct my bill ?
"Hi, Virgin! I'm on hold for 40-50 minutes -- are there any earlier flights from LA to NYC tonight; earlier than 11:50pm?"
"Hi, Virgin, I like your services"
"Your services are bad, its not as expected"
Its very unfortunate that I did not get what I expected
"This is not good, improve!"
I waited for 40 minutes but we left though
"this is very nice, I enjoyed"
This is the worst plane experience in my life
I enjoyed my journey on this flight
